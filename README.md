Project Title:Smart Predictive Modeling for Rental Property Prices

Technologies:Cleaning, EDA, Visualization, ML

Domain:Real Estate & Property Management

Problem Statement:
In the real estate industry, determining the appropriate rental price for a property is crucial for
property owners, tenants, and property management companies. Accurate rent predictions can
help landlords set competitive prices, tenants make informed rental decisions, and property
management companies optimize their portfolio management.
The goal of this project is to develop a data-driven model that predicts the rental price of
residential properties based on relevant features. By analyzing historical rental data and
property attributes, the model aims to provide accurate and reliable rent predictions.
